# Shopping Cart Functionality Testing Plan

## Steps to Test:

1. **Verify Cart Initialization**:
   - Ensure that the cart initializes as an empty array.
   - Check that the "Your cart is currently empty" message displays when there are no items in the cart.

2. **Add Items to Cart**:
   - Test adding items from the `ProductsPage.js` to the cart.
   - Verify that the cart updates correctly with the added items.

3. **Update Item Quantities**:
   - Test increasing and decreasing item quantities in the `ShoppingCart.js`.
   - Ensure that the total price updates accordingly.

4. **Remove Items from Cart**:
   - Test removing items from the cart and verify that they are no longer displayed.

5. **Clear Cart Functionality**:
   - Test the "Clear Cart" button to ensure it empties the cart.

6. **Total Price Calculation**:
   - Verify that the total price displayed in the cart is accurate based on the items and their quantities.

7. **Checkout Process**:
   - Test the "Proceed to Checkout" button to ensure it navigates to the checkout page (if applicable).

8. **Support Links**:
   - Verify that the support links (call and WhatsApp) work correctly.
